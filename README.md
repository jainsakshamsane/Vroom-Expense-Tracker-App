# Vroom-Expense-Tracker-App

I have developed a mobile application named "Vroom Expense Tracker" that requires user registration and login, and can be logged in with your registered device FINGERPRINT. Once logged in, users can add an unlimited number of expenses, including the option of adding Amount, Date, Category and Product Name. The application features an "Expenses" section where users can view their added expenses ensuring a clutter-free interface by excluding past users expenses. Calculate Total button is there to calculate expenses for any day on the next page and for month wise from-to days too. To enhance user experience, I have incorporated a help button, CALL Developer button to directly make a call, if facing any issue. This comprehensive set of features and design choices aims to provide a seamless and efficient reminder management experience for users.
